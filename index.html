        <h2>1. Carry reusable shopping bags</h2>
        <img style="width:500px" src="https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/49/8f/498fba96-e5a7-467c-af29-dce1c6151a10/screen_shot_2018-12-20_at_51159_pm.png__1104x729_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">TreeHugger recommends carrying a reusable shopping bag with you, which could reduce your plastic usage by more than 300 bags per year. People use an estimated 100 billion plastic bags each year in the US alone. Around the world, between 500 billion
            and 1 trillion are used annually, but only 1 in every 200 bags gets recycled, according to nonprofit organization ConservingNow. Billions of them instead end up as litter that lingers for hundreds of years.</p>
        <h2>2. Drink Your Coffee From a Reusable Cup</h2>
        <img style="width: 500px;" src="https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/29/eb/29eb686c-30b0-48cc-95a8-d98e4e5119af/screen_shot_2018-12-20_at_51441_pm.png__643x383_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Over 500 billion single-use coffee cups are thrown away each year around the world. These cups range from full plastic cups to plastic-lined paper cups topped with plastic lids. Often, these cups end up in landfills where they take years to breakdown.
            By bringing a reusable cup or mug to your favorite coffee shop, you can be part of the solution, according to World Wildlife Fund. Some stores will even give you a discount for bringing your own cup.</p>
        <h2>3. Avoid Bottled Water</h2>
        <img style="width: 500px;" src="https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/aa/e9/aae99585-5383-4091-80db-ccc578d825ab/screen_shot_2018-12-20_at_44647_pm.png__1093x735_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Americans used an estimated 50 billion plastic water bottles last year, but only 23% were actually recycled. Bottled water not only adds to plastic pollution after use, but its production demands a massive amount of fossil fuels that also contribute
            to environmental degradation. Around 17 million barrels of oil, more than enough to fill 1 million cars with fuel, are used to make water plastic water bottles in the US each year. Switching to a BPA-free reusable water bottle will benefit
            the earth and your health while saving you money after as few as 10 uses, according to TreeHugger.</p>
        <h2>4. Swap Out Bottles for Bars</h2>
        <img style="width:500px;" src="https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/67/09/670919c4-ed21-42c0-ae1c-dd9ce28d6064/screen_shot_2018-12-20_at_50020_pm.png__1152x757_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Switching from liquid body wash and shampoo, which typically come in plastic bottles, to bar soaps and shampoos can help cut down on your personal plastic usage and your impact on the environment, according to My Plastic Free Life. One study found
            that liquid soap requires five times as much energy to formulate and 20 times as much energy to package, compared to bar soap.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">However, bar soaps aren't without their own disadvantages. Many are made with animal or plant fats that require resource-intensive agriculture, and people tend to use more hot water when rinsing it off than with liquid soaps, a study suggests.
            So, look out for eco-friendly brands and mind your water usage when using bar soaps.</p>
        <h2>5. Avoid Buying Clothes Made With Plastic</h2>
        <img style="width: 500px;" src="https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/9e/51/9e51c5f6-9ede-4da5-900a-8fb2093c8358/screen_shot_2018-12-20_at_50231_pm.png__1101x718_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.png">
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Clothing is a major source of microplastic pollution, according to Plastic Pollution Coalition. Materials like polyester, nylon, acrylic, and other synthetic fibers are all types of plastic and are present in about 60% of clothing made today.
            As a result, simply putting clothes through the wash can release thousands of tiny plastic fibers into the water system, which eventually make their way into the ocean.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">Although most textiles are recyclable, 85% of used clothing ends up in landfills and the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing each year. Like plastic bags, synthetic clothing can take hundreds of years to decompose. Buying second-hand
            clothes is one of the most environmentally friendly ways to shop since it keep plastic out of the waste stream and doesn't demand new energy to produce.</p>
